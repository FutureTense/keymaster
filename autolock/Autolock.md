# Auto Lock

While some locks have AutoLock built in (please disable them if you use this or
your own automations), this implementation has more functionality.  If
`input_boolean.autolock` is on, then your door will automatically lock itself
after a defined period.  But there are times when you may not want this, such
as if you're hosting a party.  Turn AutoLock off so it's not becoming a problem
for everyone.  Note, this will automatically turn on after 4 hours, though this
duration is easily changed.

## autolock_lovelace.yml

This defines a simple UI for controlling and monitoring AutoLock.  When
enabled, AutoLock will watch for frontdoor to be locked/unlocked.  When the
door is unlocked a timer will be started via the script
*start_frontdoor_custom_timer*.  If the time is after dusk, the timer duration
is 5 minutes otherwise it's 15.
